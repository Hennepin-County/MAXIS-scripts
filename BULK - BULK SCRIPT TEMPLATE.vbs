'-------------------------->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>INFO ABOUT THIS TEMPLATE<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<------------------------------------
'This template is a generic form for building custom bulk scripts for MAXIS that collect a list of cases from a rept, then check various panels
'to determine further case information, and if the case meets the desired criteria, add it to an excel list.
'Because the master case list is pulled into an array, rather than to the excel file, time savings should be realized when
'using this format to search a caseload for specific case types.
'The user will need to add a significant amount of coding to this template to have a functional script.
